Guinea Pigs was an installation by Lydia Kallipoliti and Andreas Theodoridis for the Istanbul Design Biennial in 2016 in response to the curators’ question “Are We Human.”

Guinea Pigs presented five species of engineered bodies: AMPHIBIAN MAN, EXOSKELETAL MAN, EXCREMENT MAN, FEEDBACK MAN and WEIGHTLESS MAN. A three-dimensional immersive projection narrated the stories of these figures, as fictional characters offset from the texture of reality; like the living ghosts of archival research. In parallel, each Guinea Pig, was presented in narrative texts, archival material, and patent drawings suspended from the ceiling and observed from a designated station on the floor, enabling the visitor to lie down and assume a horizontal position in the exhibition space. The change of posture from vertical to horizontal turns the viewer him/herself into a guinea pig, into an object that is observed, monitored and documented by the curators.

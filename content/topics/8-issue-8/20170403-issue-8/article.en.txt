PROPS: What is the role of images in your research?
 
Lydia: Images have undeniably features, form and character, yet from the moment they are experienced, they are transformed and redesigned as in our minds. They always carry a composite story, half extracted from actual events and half recounted in the mind through a reconstructive impromptu narrative.

In our perturbed new world of “post-truth,” images can be powerful tools of battle. We are possibly in dire need of a new kind of imagery to announce events, to tell stories and to shape our reality. If every bit of fact is now designed, the role of design of images has, albeit unwittingly, expanded to more than shaping the aesthetic and experiential aptitudes of our daily existence. In many ways, the design of images as a form of resistance has acquired civilizational value. It needs to narrate the silent unspoken curvature and shape of space itself, unearth the bedrock of the post-truth era, rendering visible an invisible battle of human displacement and disembowelment of livelihood.
